# EditFrontMatter: Example 2 Readme

Example 2 builds upon the 1st example by demonstrating that file content can manipulated and reprocessed a second time. A practical use case for this capability might include yaml content that is dependant on other file yaml data. The ability to use multiple jinja templates to process yaml data is also demonstrated. The code documentation provides notes for program flow.


The documentation for the program can be found [here](https://karlredman.github.io/EditFrontMatter/examples/example2/example2.html).

## Running the program:

* install dependencies

* run from anywhere with the environment variable:
```
TEST_DATA_DIR="./data/" example2/example2.py
```
